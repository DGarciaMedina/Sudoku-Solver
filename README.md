# Sudoku-Solver

Here is a personal project that attempts to solve one of the most popular games known: Sudoku

The repository has the core algorithm program **Sudoku_Solver_algorithm.py** that can be used as an example, which solves the SUDOKU without the GUI (from pre-definied NumPy arrays acting as the grid) and returns the number of iterations required to solve the puzzle.

On the other hand there is the full program **Sudoku_Solver_with_GUI.py** The implementation shown required Tkinter in order to produce the GUI.

In order to start the program with GUI, simply run the Sudoku_Solver_with_GUI.py making sure that the Sudoku_Solver_algorithm.py is in the same folder.

Instructions on how to use the GUI:

1. Type in the numbers into the correct position of the grid.

2. Press the button START to solve the program.
