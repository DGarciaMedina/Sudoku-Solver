# Sudoku-Solver

Here is a personal project that attempts to solve one of the most popular games known: Sudoku

The repository has the example program **Sudoku Solver example.py**, which solves the SUDOKU without the GUI (from pre-definied NumPy arrays acting as the grid).

On the other hand there is the full program **GUI Sudoku.py** The implementation shown required Tkinter in order to produce the GUI.
